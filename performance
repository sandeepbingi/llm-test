Measure of Success
1. Infrastructure Setup:
* Successful provisioning of new servers for Dev, QA, and Prod environments, ensuring high availability and scalability.
* Proper isolation of environments using separate NAS mounts, with no data overlap or security issues.
2. WebSocket Configuration:
* NGINX WebSocket proxy successfully handles real-time traffic for the OnePay Walmart Application without performance bottlenecks.
* WebSocket connectivity validated via external tools (e.g., Postman) with no connectivity issues.
3. Automation:
* CloudBees pipelines and Deploy agents are fully functional, enabling seamless deployment of NGINX configurations across all environments.
* Automatic NGINX startup scripts work reliably on all servers.
4. Monitoring and Alerts:
* Splunk logs are onboarded for all environments, and the ngin_wehsocket logs_monitoring_dashboard provides real-time insights.
* Alerts are configured in Splunk to notify the team of any anomalies or issues.
5. Operational Handover:
* Ownership successfully handed over to the Run team, with all documentation and processes in place for smooth operations.
* Minimal post-handover issues reported, indicating a successful transition.
6. Business Impact:
* The infrastructure and WebSocket configuration improve the performance and reliability of the OnePay Walmart Application, leading to enhanced user experience.
* The project is delivered on time and meets all client requirements, contributing to overall client satisfaction.
